## Features

- **React.js-Based**: Built entirely with **React.js**, utilizing component-based architecture for a modular and scalable codebase.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface, managing game logic, and ensuring interactive and smooth gameplay.

## How It Works
1. **Game Setup**: Players take turns rolling dice and moving around the board.
